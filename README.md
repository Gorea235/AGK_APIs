AGK_APIs
========

Just a small bunch of APIs for AGK when writing games. They contain functions that might help you write the games you want. The SME API is currently the API with the most work put into it. They should have a 'how to use' inside the file itself if you don't know what to do with it.

Use if you want to, I will be updating them to improve features, compatibility and stability.
