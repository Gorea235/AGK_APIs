AGK_APIs
========

This is my first ever GitHub repository!

Just a small bunch of APIs for AGK when writing games. They contain functions that might help you write the games you want. The SME API is currently the API with the most work put into it. They should have a 'how to use' inside the file itself if you don't know what to do with it.

Use if you want to, I will be updating them to improve features, compatibility and stability.

Please tell me if there are any issues with using the APIs are I will try to solve them as quickly as possible. If there are any function name/parameter changes they should be documented with the commit description to allow you to adjust your code if nessecary. 

The SME API was originally made to get around the 12 button limit AGK has, and I also decided to add more functionality to the buttons than the default ones. 

If you wish to use this in your programs, then can you make sure that I am notified, I should generally be ok with it, and that I am mentioned as a contributor.
